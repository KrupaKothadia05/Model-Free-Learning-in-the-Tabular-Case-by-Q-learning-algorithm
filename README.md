# Model-Free-Learning-in-the-Tabular-Case-by-Q-learning-algorithm
•	Developed a maze and the Q- learning algorithm for an AI agent to pick the shortest path from start to goal.
•	Assigned 3 different kind of rewards and various hyper-parameter tuning to get the optimal policy for an agent to perform the most efficient action at every states
